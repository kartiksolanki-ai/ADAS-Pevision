# ADAS-Pevision
This project aimed to enhance pedestrian safety by developing an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) that focuses on detecting and predicting pedestrian movements. The system leverages YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm, to identify pedestrians in live video feeds or pre-recorded footage.
